# CodeAlpha_Sales_Price_Prediction

This is a sales prediction project using Python. It starts with basic data importation and visualization using libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. 
Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a basic sales prediction model using Python. The dataset used in this project is related to advertising and its effect on sales, featuring key variables like TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising expenditures.

Project Structure
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Descriptive statistics and an overview of the dataset.
Visualization of relationships between variables to understand the data better.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, checking data types, and preparing data for model building.
Model Building:
Various regression techniques may be applied to predict sales based on advertising spend across different channels.
Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Visualization: Plots and graphs are used extensively to visualize the data and model results.
Libraries Used
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
